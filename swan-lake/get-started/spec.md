## Introduction

This is the specification for the GraphQL standard library of the [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io)[ language](https://ballerina.io), which provides GraphQL server functionalities to produce GraphQL APIs and GraphQL client functionalities to communicate with GraphQL APIs.

The GraphQL library specification has evolved and may continue to evolve in the future. The released versions of the specification can be found under the relevant GitHub tag.

If you have any feedback or suggestions about the library, start a discussion via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/ballerina-platform/ballerina-standard-library/issues) or in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ballerinalang). Based on the outcome of the discussion, the specification and implementation can be updated. Community feedback is always welcome. Any accepted proposal, which affects the specification is stored under `/docs/proposals`. Proposals under discussion can be found with the label `type/proposal` on GitHub.

The conforming implementation of the specification is released and included in the distribution. Any deviation from the specification is considered a bug.
